# Pong
Pong is one of the oldest computer games out there, and this will be my
rendition in python. The game will be two player with the first player
playing on the WASD keys and the second player playing on the arrows. 
Just to give a brief overview of the logic of the game, the game is played
where the two users go back in forth trying to score in the opposite's goal by
hitting the ball with their paddle. First one to seven wins!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and raylib-py.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib-py
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 cse-210-final/pong 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- pong                (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __init__.py       (python package file)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
